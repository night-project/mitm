A customizable man-in-the-middle TCP proxy with support for HTTP & HTTPS.

## Installing

```
pip install mitm
```

Note that OpenSSL 1.1.1 or greater is required.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [**here**](https://synchronizing.github.io/mitm/). 

## Using

Using the default values for the `MITM` class:

```python
from mitm import MITM, protocol, middleware, crypto

mitm = MITM(
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=8888,
    protocols=[protocol.HTTP],
    middlewares=[middleware.Log],
    certificate_authority = crypto.CertificateAuthority()
)
mitm.run()
```

This will start a proxy on port 8888 that is capable of intercepting all HTTP traffic (with support for SSL/TLS) and log all activity.

## Extensions

`mitm` can be customized through the implementations of middlewares and protocols. 

[Middlewares](https://synchronizing.github.io/mitm/customizing/middlewares.html) are event-driven hooks that are called when a connection is made, request is sent, response is received, and connection is closed. 

[Protocols](https://synchronizing.github.io/mitm/customizing/protocols.html) are implementations on _how_ the data flows between the client and server, and is responsible for the nitty-gritty details of the protocol. Out of the box `mitm` supports HTTP and HTTPS.

## Example

Using the example above we can send a request to the server via another script:

```python
import requests

proxies = {"http": "http://127.0.0.1:8888", "https": "http://127.0.0.1:8888"}
requests.get("https://httpbin.org/anything", proxies=proxies, verify=False)
```

Which will lead to the following being logged where `mitm` is running in:
